			<p><b>Bee's Design</b> was the name of the freelance web development business I started when I was eighteen. My goal was to make websites for local businesses in my area. I worked on several small projects, and learned a lot of technologies in the process.</p>

			<p>The application was built completely from scratch. Over a period of three weeks, I built this website with the goal of learning Twitter's Bootstrap.</p>
