			<p>This website was the launch page for a local startup named <b>Spotter</b> when I was in college. The company had a goal to track fitness programs with their own custom bluetooth device.</p>

			<p><b>Spotter</b> already had a <i>very</i> basic template picked out for the project, but they needed assistance implementing some of the features on the website. I added two pages to the project, fixed bugs in the template, and changed the color and content to match the overall theme of the website.</p>
