			<p><b>FactsOfToday</b> was the result of a group senior project in an iOS Development course in college. The goal for the application was to provide an easy way for people to find out interesting information about facts that happened on a certain day in history. It also notifies the user everyday with a new fact related to that day.</p>

			<p>The application was built completely from scratch. Over a period of three months, our group used agile methodologies in order to make sure that <b>FactsOfToday</b> was completed in a timely manner. With the assistance of some mentors, we were able to get our project ready for presentation day.</p>

			<p>Over the course of the project, I was given the task of implementing the built in calendar, creating the swipe-able view that the user interacts with, and creating the local notifications to show users new facts.</p>
