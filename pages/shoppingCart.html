			<p>This project was the result of a small challenge I put myself to. I was curious on how single page applications worked, so I created a shop with three parts:

			<ul>
				<li>A form to add new products to a "shop"</li>
				<li>A list that represents products in the shop</li>
				<li>A subset list of selected items from the shop</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The application was built using AngularJS with Twitter Bootstrap for a simple template. The whole project took me about 6 hours. The shop also validates whether a correct value was put in! When testing the app, make sure to know that the information is stored locally, not in a database. The information won't be restored on refresh!</p>

			<h2><b>Built With</b></h2>
			<ul>
					<li>HTML5/CSS3</li>
					<li>JavaScript</li>
					<li>AngularJS</li>
					<li>Bootstrap</li>
			</ul>
