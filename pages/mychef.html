			<p>This website was the foundation for a local startup named <b><i>myChef</i></b> when I was in college. The goal for the website was to provide an application that could find local chefs in the nearby area. It was also planned to be used in order to provide training and work experience to up-and-coming chefs</p>

			<p><b><i>myChef</i></b> was built completely from scratch. The founder had a general idea of how many pages he wanted, and the content he wanted on it, but I was given creative freedom to make the website elegant, and pick the color scheme of the website.</p>

			<p>Over the course of the project, I was able to implement both Facebook and Google Authentication, but the founder settled on a simple, yet secure email and password authentication system.</p>
