			<p><b>MedxPort</b> was the final result of my group's submission for MHacks 2015. The goal for the application was to provide an easy way for people to check in to the doctor. MedxPort would allow a user to pre-fill out its information, and when the time came to check in, all the user would have to do is scan a QR code, and their information would be filled out onto the appropriate forms. We also built a web application for users to sign up and fill out their application.</p>

			<p>The application was built over the 24 hour period MHacks gave to us. With the assistance from some mentors that were provided, and guidance from Firebase engineers, <b>MedxPort</b> was functional within the time allotted. Although we didn't win any big prizes, my team caught the attention of several medical companies at the hackathon who were interested in our idea. We continued to work on it for a few months to polish the application until it was completely functional.</p>

			<p>Over the course of the project, I was given the task of creating the whole iOS app, architecting the backend with AngularJS and Firebase that the user will store its information in, and assisting in creating the calendar that users could use to schedule doctor's appointments.</p>
